    <p>The Indonesian part of the Coral Triangle, a huge area with thousands of islands, contains seagrass beds considered the most biologically diverse（） in the world. But research has shown these have been significantly damaged since 2013. Leanne Cullen-Unsworth of the United Kingdom’s Cardiff University calls this a “tragedy of the seagrass commons” - a reference to an economic problem in which people overuse a shared resource, thinking only of their own short term benefit and ultimately causing its destruction（）. Seagrass beds in Indonesia, she says, are often overlooked by conservationists, so they are poorly monitored（）. Their loss threatens the livelihood of millions of people in the surrounding area as the fish these people rely on for food and income become scarce（）. It could also reduce the populations of endangered species that live in seagrass beds, such as sea horses.
